## Motivation

This project was done as an introduction to manipulating the DOM using javascript, including adding elements dynamically as well as adding some interactive functionality such as smooth scrolling and dynamic highlighting effects.
I have mainly just added the JS file with few further modifications to the started code, apart from some minor tweaking of CSS (changes in some colors and the highlighting effects) and a button to return to the top of page.

## Code Style

The project was made with vanilla JS, no jQuery or other frameworks were used.
